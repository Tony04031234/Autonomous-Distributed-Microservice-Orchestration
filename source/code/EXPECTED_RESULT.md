# Expected Result

The project aims to provide a reliable system for communication between the HQ, Agents, and Fire Trucks. The following are the expected results and outcomes of the project:

1. **Message Routing**: Messages sent from the HQ should be successfully received and processed by the Agents. The Agents should then route the messages to the appropriate Fire Trucks for further action.

2. **Reliable Communication**: The system should ensure reliable communication between the components, even in the presence of network issues or component failures. The implemented reliability strategies, such as Retry and Failover, should handle failures effectively and provide seamless communication.

   - (done) Retry strategy**: Implemented a retry mechanism to perform failed activities again, either immediately or after a certain delay.

   - [x] **Failover strategy**: Implemented failover mechanism to reroute activities to alternative endpoints or replicas when the primary one fails.
   - [x] **Fallback strategy: Fallback is the strategy of using a different mechanism or approach to achieve the same result when the primary method fails. (considering pros and cons)

3. **Fault Tolerance**: The system should exhibit fault tolerance capabilities. In the event of a node failure or unavailability of an Agent or Fire Truck, the system should automatically route the activities to alternative instances or replicas to ensure continuity of service.

4. **Error Handling**: The system should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages or fallback mechanisms when an activity cannot be completed successfully. Error logs and monitoring should be in place to identify and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

5. **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale horizontally by adding more Agents or Fire Trucks to meet increasing demands. The deployment configuration in Kubernetes should support scaling without disrupting the overall system functionality.

6. **Documentation and Test Coverage**: The project should include comprehensive documentation that explains the system architecture, setup instructions, and how to utilize the reliability strategies effectively. Additionally, a robust test suite should be in place to validate the system's reliability and functionality under different scenarios.
