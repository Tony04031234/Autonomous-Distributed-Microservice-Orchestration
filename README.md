# Autonomous Distributed Microservice Orchestration

**Supervisors:** Sree Ram Boyapati (University of Adelaide), Zihan Zawad (Swordfish Computing)

**Context:** : When emergency services respond to major events, such a floods or bushfires, they use software systems and apps to help do their job better. Those software systems are supported by services which may not work well when they are disconnected from the internet.

For example, a fire truck may transmit its position and a video to the fire headquarters (HQ). The servers at the HQ might also serve up map, and other, data to the fire truck. How would a system like this work if the fire truck drives into a valley that has no radio connection to the HQ?

**Problem:** Design an autonomous, distributed micro service system that can keep services running as best as possible even when the network connection is poor and there are limited computing resources available.

**Research Tasks:** 
- Implement a containerised microservice test environment, design and implement experiments to test the orchestration system 
- As a stretch goal, design and test new distributed orchestration algorithms.
